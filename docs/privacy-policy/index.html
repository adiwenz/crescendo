            <p>Crescendo respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and protected when you use the Crescendo mobile application.</p>
            
            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
            <p>Crescendo is a vocal training application that provides guided singing exercises, real-time pitch feedback, and progress tracking. The app is designed to operate primarily on-device and does not sell or share personal data.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            
            <h3>Microphone / Audio Data</h3>
            <p>Crescendo requests access to your device's microphone (RECORD_AUDIO permission) solely to enable user-initiated vocal exercises, pitch detection, and optional audio recording features. Audio access is only active while an exercise is running.</p>
            
            <p><strong>We do not continuously listen, record, or access audio in the background.</strong></p>
            
            <h3>Other Data</h3>
            <p>Crescendo may store locally generated exercise results, scores, and recordings on your device. These are created as a result of your direct interaction with the app.</p>
            
            <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
            
            <p>Audio input is used only to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Detect pitch in real time during vocal exercises</li>
                <li>Record practice sessions when you explicitly start a recording</li>
                <li>Provide feedback and progress tracking features within the app</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Audio data is not used for advertising, profiling, or tracking purposes.</strong></p>
            
            <h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
            
            <p>By default, audio recordings and exercise data are stored locally on your device.<br>
            Crescendo does not automatically upload audio recordings to external servers.</p>
            
            <p>If you choose to export, share, or back up recordings, that action is initiated explicitly by you.</p>
            
            <p>You may delete recordings and exercise data at any time from within the app or by uninstalling the app.</p>
            
            <h2>5. Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
            
            <p>Crescendo does not sell, rent, or trade your personal data.<br>
            Audio data is not shared with third parties and is not used for ad targeting or analytics.</p>
            
            <h2>6. Permissions</h2>
            
            <p>Crescendo requests the following permission:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Microphone (RECORD_AUDIO):</strong> Required only to perform vocal exercises and recordings initiated by the user.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>You may revoke this permission at any time through your device settings. Some features may not function without microphone access.</p>
            
            <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
            
            <p>Crescendo is not directed toward children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that a child has provided personal data, please contact us so it can be removed.</p>
            
            <h2>8. Security</h2>
            
            <p>Reasonable technical and organizational measures are used to protect data stored on your device. However, no method of storage or transmission is completely secure.</p>
            
            <h2>9. Your Choices</h2>
            
            <p>You can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Control microphone access through system permissions</li>
                <li>Delete recordings and exercise data</li>
                <li>Stop using the app and uninstall it at any time</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            
            <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.</p>
