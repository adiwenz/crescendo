# Crescendo 🎶

*A voice training app for building pitch accuracy, control, and confidence.*

## What is Crescendo?

Crescendo is a mobile app that helps singers improve their voice through interactive exercises and real-time pitch feedback.
It combines structured vocal warmups with a visual “pitch highway” that shows how closely you’re matching target notes as you sing.

The goal is simple: **make vocal practice clear, measurable, and motivating**—without needing a piano, teacher, or studio setup.

## Core Features

* 🎯 Real-time pitch detection and visual feedback
* 🎼 Range-aware vocal exercises
* 📈 Progress tracking and exercise completion
* 🔓 Difficulty levels that unlock as you improve
* 🔁 Review your last take and replay pitch contours
